dpdk (2.0.0-0ubuntu3) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Only generate HTML documentation, easing backports to 14.04 and
    reducing the time to build and size of the -doc package (LP: #1524700).

dpdk (2.0.0-0ubuntu2) xenial; urgency=low

  * d/p/ubunut-avoid-texlive-fonts-extra, d/control:
    Replace use of DejaVuSansMono by courier and drop dependency on the
    texlive-fonts-extra package (which is in universe).
  * d/watch added to allow use of uscan to check for upstream releases.
  * d/dpdk-init: fix error if bash variables could not be resolved that
    appeared as "[: -gt: unexpected operator" (had no functional impact)
  * d/dpdk-init:
    Replace use of head and cut (in /usr/bin) commands with sed (in /bin)
    while also adding /usr/bin to the PATH used on direct /etc/init.d/dpdk
    invocation. The PATH is only updated to be on the safe side, there
    should be no other commands from /usr/bin used (LP: #1516543).
  * d/t/test-mountpoint: add dep8 test to cover the issue of LP #1517075.
  * d/dpdk-dev.install: Copy the SDK makefiles into place (LP: #1517075).
